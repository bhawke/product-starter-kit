# Stage 2 Feedback

During Stage 2, you'll want to give out some prototypes to a small group of people and collect some feeback from those people.  So you'll want to clearly define what feedback you want from people.

The list of questions below is a sample set of questions from John Cleveland's Chore Bots:

Tell me something about yourself:
If you were able to play one of the following games, which would you choose to play:
-- Chess or Stratego
-- Go fish 
-- 



Chores and Bot Coins


Upgrading
1. How do the boys decide what part to upgrade: (each of the boys)  
Strategy? ________%
Color? ____________%
Cost vs. amount they have earned?  ______%
Other: _________________________

3. How do the boys feel about the sticker upgrade system?



Battles
How often did you allow the boys to go to battle?

How do the boys decide who to attack?

Do the boys talk to each other to decide who to attack?

Are the rules for the battles overwhelming for your youngest child?

What is the frequency of your children winning battles: 
# wins vs. # of losses

When your child lost a battle, what was the reaction (feeling), and what did they do about the reaction 
--do chores so they could upgrade a part, 
--discuss strategy with you,
--ask to battle again that same day,
--claim that it was luck that made them lost
--want to stop playing the game

As a parent, do you enjoy doing a battle? 
--how long do the battles take? _____ Minutes per battle
--does the length of time 
--How much strategy do you feel you use in the battle system by representing the alien robot?  (Scale 1 to 10)
--How much strategy do you WANT or EXPECT to use in a game you are playing with your children? (Scale 1 to 10)
is there enough strategy involved for the parent when controlling an enemy bot?

General
How did you decide (as parents) who manages the game:  
--How often do you hand out bot coins? Mom_____%    Dad_____% 
--Who upgrades parts, %
--Who conducts battles, % ?
--What criteria do you use for the division of labor?  





One final question: how much do you feel the enjoyment of the game (and feedback) was affected by the fact that this is a lower-quality prototype?  

(I want to isolate feedback based on the mechanics of the game, which we need to know whether or not to change, and feedback based on the quality of graphics and materials, which will definitely change).
