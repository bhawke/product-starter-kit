# Product Development Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the overall process for developing a product and bringing it to market.  There are several key stages during this process.

### Stage 1: Develop the first prototype

  - Develop the first prototype for your own personal use
  - Don't worry at all about the name of your product at this point
  - Market research to determine existing products

The goal in this stage is to build the minimum prototype possible, that is still just barely functional in order to get to Stage 2, which is really where you'll get feedback for product improvement.

### Stage 2: Test the prototype

  - Give several prototypes to a small group of people
  - Define what feedback you want from your beta testers
  - Collect feedback and refine the product

The prototypes you give out should be free in Stage 2.  The number of prototypes you give out is highly dependent on the nature of the product.  If prototypes are fast and easy to produce (like a piece of software), you could give out many prototypes.  But as a general rule the number should be more than 2 and less than 50.  You won't be able to effectively collect feedback from more than 50 users at this stage.  Also, while friends and family are the most accessible testers, we recommend finding at least one person that you don't know to do testing.  How to do this?  We don't know.

See feedback.md for a sample feedback form that John Cleveland provided to testers of his product Chore Bots.

### Stage 3: Broader user validation

  - Build a landing page to collect potential interested customers
  - Give the product its first "real" name
  - 

In many cases it makes sense to do some of Stage 3 work in parallel with Stage 2.  Don't spend too much time giving the product a name at this stage, since the name will likely change again.  You should do a quick trademark search on the USTO trademark search engine to make sure you're not infringing on an existing trademark.  But again, don't get too attached to the name here.

### Stage 4: Obtaining funding

  - Write business plan
  - Begin the marketing plan
  - 

### Questions you need to be able to answer

  - Are you building a commodity or a technology?
  - Are you building a vitamin or a pain killer?
