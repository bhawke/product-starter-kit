# Trademarks

A product will probably eventually need a trademark.

You can run a quick and easy search on the trademark search system to determine if someone is already using a name.  This is probably a good idea to make sure you don't infringe on someone else's trademark.

At some point, you'll probably want to pay an attorney to perform an exhaustive trademark search.  This will probably cost somewhere between $750-$1000 to pay the attorney, so put this off as long as possible.
